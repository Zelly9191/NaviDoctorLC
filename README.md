# NaviDoctorLC
Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection save editor

NOTICE: Currently only supports MMBN1 for the Battle Network Legacy Collection for Steam.

Features:

- Edit MegaMan.EXE's HP and stats
- Equip and add Armors to your inventory
- Edit chip quantities in your Pack
- Fully functional Folder Editor
- Add/Remove entries to your chip Library

Experimental features:

- Recognizes Switch version saves (set Steam ID field to 0)*
- Can transfer saves to other people by editing the Steam ID

Known Issues:

- Trying to save with less than 30 chips in your folder generates an Index Out of Range error. I'll be adding a more user-friendly warning box that explains this better.
- It is possible to edit your HP to 1000, then obtain an HP Memory in game to increase your HP past the base limit. Doing so will disable your ability to PvP Netbattle. The editor already takes this into account, so if you find yourself in this situation, save your game, load your file in the editor, and simply save again. The editor automatically tries to make sure you are able to PvP Netbattle.

Coming Soon:
- Support for Mega Man Battle Network 2
- Fully functional Style Editor: change your currently equipped style as well as your obtained styles!
- Expanded Folder Viewer: edit up to three of your unlocked Folders, for BN2+
- Editing capabilities for RegMem, BugFrags, SubChips, and the entire P.A. Memo Library
- An "Add All" button to increase the quantity of ALL chips to your pack by the desired amount!

Thank you for your patience while these features are being worked on! As always, NaviDoctor will strive to keep players within legitimately obtainable limits to ensure your ability to be Netbattle ready!

Future features and additions:

- Support for the entire MMBNLC line of games!
- NaviCust Editor (BN3+)
- NaviCust Parts editor: obtain NaviCust parts you want, and compress/decompress your parts at will without having to find and input lengthy button codes
- Probably more, I literally just started this project about a week ago.

Special thanks to MegaRockEXE, Prof. 9, Weenie, luckytyphlosion, GreigaMaster, and the rest of the TREZ community for your support!

*NOTICE: NaviDoctor LC does not enable the downloading or transfer of Switch version saves to PC nor is it a function I intend to pursue.
